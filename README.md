# Online Doctor Appointment ddd

DUONG++++++Patients can select a desired doctor appointment date through the online platform. This project is developed using the MERN stack technology, and I have implemented various functionalities to make it a professional website. Currently, I do not have much time, but in the future, I plan to add additional functionality in the admin panel. For now, the current state is sufficient.

##Setting up this MERN project on your local machine typically involves the following steps:
###The front-end and Express code are in the same directory, with the Express API located at ./api
1. Clone or download the project source code to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies. This can be done using a package manager such as npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn.
3. Run the development server. This can be done using a command line tool such as the terminal, where you can run the command npm start or yarn start.
4. Access the project in your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` or another specified URL.
